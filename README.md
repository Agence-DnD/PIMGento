PIMGento is a Magento extension that allows you to import your catalog from Akeneo CSV files into Magento.

# Magento >= 1.9.3

For Magento >= 1.9.3, referer to branch magento-1.9.3

## How it works

PIMGento reads CSV files from Akeneo and insert data directly in Magento database.

In this way, it makes imports very fast and doesn't disturb your e-commerce website.

With PIMGento, you can import :
* Categories
* Families
* Attributes
* Options
* Products
* Products positions by category
* Images
* Stocks

## Features

* **Plug and Play:** We payed attention to the code and followed the Magento code instructions so you can easily install this extension on your store without any troubleshooting (see [installation](#installation)).

* **Totally flexible:** We added plenty of configurations. We didn't write any specific value in our code : No hard coding.

* **User Friendly:** We thought the interface the easiest possible. We developed a dashboard where you can see your import running. We even added some colors :)

* **Manual or automatic:** Free to choose ! You can either upload and import your CSV files from the Magento back-office or simply let the automatics tasks run different import with CSV files located in a directory of your server.

* **SEO ready:** 404 pages, it's over ! With PIMGento, you don't loose SEO on your product and category pages. If their names change, PIMGento create automatically a rewrite from the old URL to the new one.

* **Synchronous** / Asynchronous: You can import right now your data in order to show them on the front-office or schedule a task in the coming days. Very useful to prepare a marketing operation for instance.

* **Fast import:** PIMGento is from 10 to 20 times faster than API and native Magento import/export system.

* **Performance:** Imports with PIMGento don't slow down the store. Besides, you can select which cache you want to clear at the end of your import.

* **Multi-X:** PIMGento supports all types of Magento structure. If you have multi-website and multi-store with lot of different languages, imports will still work well.
